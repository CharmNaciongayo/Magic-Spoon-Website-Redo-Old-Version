# Magic-Spoon-Website-Redo-Old-Version-
This is an attempt to redo the Magic Spoon website. This was more of an exploratory project in which I tried to better understand how CSS Flexbox works, and not all design elements are present in the code. The main strength of this page is that it is quite close to the original siteâ€™s landing page when executed, and the HTML and CSS are organized and structured well. However, there is some redundancy in the CSS code, specifically some styles that override one another, and the site could be more responsive on various screen sizes.
